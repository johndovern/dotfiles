meant to be forked and maintained as a bare git repo. using reverse .gitignore technique to allow for seemless maintenence. nothing unless explicitly added to the proper .gitignore file or forced with -f will be added to this repo. that might be weird or cumbersome in a normal repo but this "repo" lives in your home. you don't want to install some shit and have git bother you about it not being tracked or having it accidently added. "Oh just add showUntrackedFiles = no to the config" okay retard. you do that if you want, i'm going to ignore everything i do not want tracked or added without my explicit say so. now i can run config add . without it adding tons of files i do not care about. if i want to track a new folder it's easy. i use ls-git (see .zshalias) to get a reverse .gitignore file created that includes everything in the directory it was run in. remove what i don't want tracked and that's it. not hard.
