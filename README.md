meant to be forked and maintained as a bare git repo. using reverse .gitignore technique to allow for seemless maintenence. nothing unless explicitly added to the proper.gitignore file or forceda with -f will be added to this repo. that might be weird or cumbersome in a normal repo but this "repo" lives in your home. i don't want to install some shit and have git bother me about it. "Oh just add showUntrackedFiles = no to your config" okay retard. you do that, i'm going to explicitly ignore everything i do not want tracked or added without my explicit say so. no i can run config add . without it adding tons of files i do not care about. if i want to add something it's easy. i use ls-git (see .zshalias) to get a reverse .gitignore file created that includes everything in the directory it was run in. remove what i don't want tracked and that's it. not hard.
